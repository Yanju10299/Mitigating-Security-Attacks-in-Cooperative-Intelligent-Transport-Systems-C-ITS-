🚗 Mitigating Security Attacks in Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS)

📌 Summer Internship (May 2025 – July 2025)
👨‍🏫 Supervisor: Prof. Ashok Singh Sairam, Department of Mathematics, IIT Guwahati

🔍 Project Overview

Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS) enable vehicles and roadside units to exchange information, enhancing road safety, efficiency, and traffic management. However, due to their open and highly dynamic nature, they are vulnerable to cyberattacks.

This project investigates key security threats in C-ITS, explores existing mitigation strategies, and is currently working on implementing lightweight, scalable, and real-time defense mechanisms for vehicular networks.

🚦 Key Security Threats Studied

Sybil Attack – Malicious nodes create multiple fake identities to mislead traffic systems.

Message Tampering – Unauthorized modification of safety-critical information.

Denial of Service (DoS) / Jamming – Disruption of communication channels to block legitimate messages.

Privacy Attacks – Tracking and profiling of vehicles without consent.

🛡️ Mitigation Strategies Explored

Cryptographic Authentication – PKI, digital certificates, digital signatures.

Trust-based Models – Reputation-based trust, cooperative evaluation systems.

Anomaly Detection – ML-based approaches for real-time detection of abnormal message patterns.

📚 Research Contributions

Performed a literature review of state-of-the-art C-ITS security mechanisms.

Analyzed trade-offs between security strength, computational cost, and scalability.

Identified research gaps in ensuring lightweight, real-time, and scalable defense for cooperative vehicular environments.

Currently developing and testing implementation models for anomaly detection & trust management.

Preparing a research paper for submission to a leading Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) conference.
