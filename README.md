Mitigating Security Attacks in Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS)

📌 Summer Internship (May 2025 – July 2025)
👨‍🏫 Supervisor: Prof. Ashok Singh Sairam, Department of Mathematics, IIT Guwahati

🔍 Project Overview

Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS) enable vehicles and infrastructure to share information in real time, improving traffic safety and efficiency. However, the open and dynamic nature of vehicular networks makes them vulnerable to a variety of cyberattacks.

This project investigates key security threats in C-ITS and evaluates mitigation strategies with the goal of developing lightweight, scalable, and real-time security solutions for future intelligent transportation systems.

🚗 Key Security Threats Studied

Sybil Attack – A malicious node creates multiple fake identities to manipulate traffic data.

Message Tampering – Attackers alter transmitted safety messages, leading to misinformation.

Denial of Service (DoS) / Jamming – Overloading or blocking communication channels.

Privacy Attacks – Unauthorized tracking and profiling of vehicles.

🛡️ Mitigation Strategies Analyzed

Cryptographic Authentication (PKI, digital signatures, certificates)

Trust-based Models (reputation systems, cooperative trust evaluation)

Anomaly Detection (machine learning and statistical approaches)

📚 Research Contributions

Conducted a comparative analysis of existing security frameworks.

Identified research gaps in ensuring scalability, lightweight computation, and real-time defense mechanisms for C-ITS.

Proposed directions for integrating federated learning and blockchain-based trust systems.

Currently authoring a research paper for submission to a leading Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) conference.
